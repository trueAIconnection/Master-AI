# Projects Directory

## Purpose
This directory contains individual folders for each SaaS project you're developing.

## Structure
Each project should have its own folder with:
- `context.md` - Project overview, goals, target audience
- `prompts.md` - Project-specific prompts and workflows
- `requirements.md` - Features, technical requirements, API needs
- `notes.md` - Development notes, decisions, lessons learned
- `api-docs.md` - API endpoints, authentication, rate limits

## Example Project Structure
```
projects/
├── saas-project-1/
│   ├── context.md
│   ├── prompts.md
│   ├── requirements.md
│   ├── notes.md
│   └── api-docs.md
├── saas-project-2/
└── saas-project-3/
```

## Best Practices
- Create a new folder for each distinct SaaS idea
- Keep context files updated as the project evolves
- Document all API integrations and authentication
- Note what prompts work best for each project type
- Archive projects that are completed or shelved

## Usage with Claude
```
"Create a new project folder for [idea name]"
"Show me the context for [project name]"
"Add these requirements to [project name]"
"What projects am I currently working on?"
```
